== Description ==

With BP WC Vendors you are able to build a highly customizable BuddyPress driven marketplace. This plugin integrates your WooCommerce shop, your BuddyPress social network and your WC vendors plugin. All WC Vendor dashboard tabs get integrated into the BuddyPress Member Profiles.

We have built many BuddyPress driven shops and marketplaces and put all our experience and knowledge into this solution.
We believe with the right combination of plugins BuddyPress is the best choice to build a powerful marketplace.
Our focus is to have an extendable and flexible environment ready to create the marketplace you need.
<br><br>

<h3>BuddyPress and WooCommerce -> The Marketplace Engine</h3>
Full social power of BuddyPress combined with the huge eco system from WooCommerce.
Ready for endless possibilities covering every use case. On point for every need.
<br><br>

<h4>More than just a plugin</h4>
We want this plugin to be a starting point and guide you through the complete process of building your marketplace.
We have bundled the best plugins together and support them all 100% with this plugin.
<br><br>

<h3>Plugin Features</h3>
<h4>Deactivate BP Vendor Dashboard Tabs</h4>
You can deactivate tabs if you not need them in your setup
<ul>
<li>Turn off "Products" tab</li>
<li>Turn off "Orders" tab</li>
<li>Turn off "Settings" tab</li>
<li>Turn off "Ratings" tab</li>
<li>Turn off "Coupons" tab</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h4>Deactivate WordPress Dashboard for Vendors</h4>
By default, only vendors will be redirected to their BuddyPress 'Member Profile Vendors Dashboard' if they try to access the backend ( /wp-admin ). All other roles will be able to access the wp admin.
In the WC Vendor Pro settings you can set WordPress dashboard to "only administrators can access the /wp-admin/ dashboard".
<br><br>

<h4>Vendor Store Settings</h4>
<ul>
<li>Redirect the Vendor Store to the BuddyPress Vendor Profile </li>
<li>Integrate into Members Profile as new Tab Select the Product Form</li>
</ul>
You can deactivate the product tab and use the BuddyForms Members extension to separate the product tab from the vendors dashboard.
If you make the product tab a main nav item it is great for showing all vendor products in the profile.
Normal profile visitors can see the vendor products. The vendor can create and edit and manage his products
<br><br>

<h4>Deactivate Links</h4>
<ul>
<li>Deactivate the "Visit Store" link in the BuddyPress Members Profile Headder</li>
<li>Deactivate the "Profile Links" in the Vendor Shop Product listings and Products Single Views</li>
<li>Deactivate the "Sold by" links in the Product Listings and Single View</li>
<li>Deactivate the "Contact Vendor" links in the Product Single View</li>
