Send messages to all members of your BuddyPress site, filter receivers by roles and groups.

== Description ==
By default, BuddyPress doesn't allow to send a private mass message to all members of your site.

This plugin allows you to send a private mass message to all members of your site, or if you prefer, to send a message just to all members of one or more specific groups or also to send a message to all members with a specific role assigned.

Although it's possible compose the messages by both frontend and backend, the front integration provides less features at moment but we improve the plugin periodically and soonthe frontend will be totally integrated.

If you have a BuddyPress community and you are looking for a way to send easily a private message to your users, then this plugin is what you are looking for.
